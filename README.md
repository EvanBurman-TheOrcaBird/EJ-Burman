- 👋 Hi, I’m Evan!
- 👀 I’m interested in GameDev, Audio Design, and Music Composition. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning WWISE, for integrating audio and music into games running on Unity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small indie games, passion projects, or anything that looks weird or interesting.
- 📫 You can reach me through the psycho-kinetic superhighways that link our subconscious brains to the great cosmos beyond... If that doesn't work then email's fine.
